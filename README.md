# Hic-data-analysis
Hi-c data processing, automation, and gene/regulatory annotation workflows developed during Hi-c internship.

# Hi-C Data Analysis Pipeline
This repository contains scripts and workflows developed during my Hi-c internship for:
- Hi-C data exploration and processing
- Automated download of Hi-C datasets from ENCODE
- Gene and regulatory annotation of chromatin interactions
- Workflow development for reproducible analysis

## Key Features
- Automated ENCODE Hi-C (.hic) data download
- Hi-C interaction extraction and processing
- TSS-centric interaction analysis
- Gene and regulatory annotation integration
- Tested on brain and breast tissue datasets
